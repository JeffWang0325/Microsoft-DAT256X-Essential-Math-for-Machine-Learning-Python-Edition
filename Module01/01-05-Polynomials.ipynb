    "# Polynomials\n",
    "Some of the equations we've looked at so far include expressions that are actually *polynomials*; but what *is* a polynomial, and why should you care?\n",
    "\n",
    "A polynomial is an algebraic expression containing one or more *terms* that each meet some specific criteria. Specifically:\n",
    "- Each term can contain:\n",
    " - Numeric values that are coefficients or constants (for example 2, -5, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub>)\n",
    " - Variables (for example, x, y)\n",
    " - Non-negative integer exponents (for example <sup>2</sup>, <sup>64</sup>)\n",
    "- The terms can be combined using arithmetic operations - but **not** division by a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following expression is a polynomial:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}12x^{3} + 2x - 16 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "When identifying the terms in a polynomial, it's important to correctly interpret the arithmetic addition and subtraction operators as the sign for the term that follows. For example, the polynomial above contains the following three terms:\n",
    "- 12x<sup>3</sup>\n",
    "- 2x\n",
    "- -16\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms themselves include:\n",
    "- Two coefficients(12 and 2) and a constant (-16)\n",
    "- A variable (x)\n",
    "- An exponent (<sup>3</sup>)\n",
    "\n",
    "A polynomial that contains three terms is also known as a *trinomial*. Similarly, a polynomial with two terms is known as a *binomial* and a polynomial with only one term is known as a *monomial*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we care? Well, polynomials have some useful properties that make them easy to work with. for example, if you multiply, add, or subtract a polynomial, the result is always another polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Form for Polynomials\n",
    "Techbnically, you can write the terms of a polynomial in any order; but the *standard form* for a polynomial is to start with the highest *degree* first and constants last. The degree of a term is the highest order (exponent) in the term, and the highest order in a polynomial determines the degree of the polynomial itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following expression:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}3x + 4xy^{2} - 3 + x^{3} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To express this as a polynomial in the standard form, we need to re-order the terms like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x^{3} + 4xy^{2} + 3x - 3 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplifying Polynomials\n",
    "We saw previously how you can simplify an equation by combining *like terms*. You can simplify polynomials in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, look at the following polynomial:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x^{3} + 2x^{3} - 3x - x + 8 - 3 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can combine x<sup>3</sup> and 2x<sup>3</sup> by adding them to make 3x<sup>3</sup>. Then we can add -3x and -x (which is really just a shorthand way to say -1x) to get -4x, and then add 8 and -3 to get 5. Our simplified polynomial then looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}3x^{3} - 4x + 5 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Python to compare the original and simplified polynomials to check them - using an arbitrary random value for ***x***:"
