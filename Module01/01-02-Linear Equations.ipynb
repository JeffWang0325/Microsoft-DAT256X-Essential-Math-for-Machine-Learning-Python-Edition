    "# Linear Equations\n",
    "The equations in the previous lab included one variable, for which you solved the equation to find its value. Now let's look at equations with multiple variables. For reasons that will become apparent, equations with two variables are known as linear equations.\n",

    "## Solving a Linear Equation\n",
    "Consider the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}2y + 3 = 3x - 1 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation includes two different variables, **x** and **y**. These variables depend on one another; the value of x is determined in part by the value of y and vice-versa; so we can't solve the equation and find absolute values for both x and y. However, we *can* solve the equation for one of the variables and obtain a result that describes a relative relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's solve this equation for y. First, we'll get rid of the constant on the right by adding 1 to both sides:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}2y + 4 = 3x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll use the same technique to move the constant on the left to the right to isolate the y term by subtracting 4 from both sides:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}2y = 3x - 4 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can deal with the coefficient for y by dividing both sides by 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y = \\frac{3x - 4}{2} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Our equation is now solved. We've isolated **y** and defined it as <sup>3x-4</sup>/<sub>2</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can't express **y** as a particular value, we can calculate it for any value of **x**. For example, if **x** has a value of 6, then **y** can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y = \\frac{3\\cdot6 - 4}{2} \\end{equation}\n",

In the notation for this, we use the greek letter &Delta; (*delta*) to represent change:\n",

    "- (0,-2)\n",
    "- (6,7)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take the x and y values from the first pair, and label them x<sub>1</sub> and y<sub>1</sub>; and then take the x and y values from the second point and label them x<sub>2</sub> and y<sub>2</sub>. Then we can plug those into our slope equation:\n",

    "### Slope-Intercept Form\n",
    "One of the great things about algebraic expressions is that you can write the same equation in multiple ways, or *forms*. The *slope-intercept form* is a specific way of writing a 2-variable linear equation so that the equation definition includes the slope and y-intercept. The generalised slope-intercept form looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y = mx + b \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notation, ***m*** is the slope and ***b*** is the y-intercept.\n",

    "For example, let's look at the solved linear equation we've been working with so far in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y = \\frac{3x - 4}{2} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the slope and y-intercept for the line that this equation defines, we can rewrite the equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y = 1\\frac{1}{2}x + -2 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see intuitively that this is true. In our original form of the equation, to find y we multiply x by three, subtract 4, and divide by two - in other words, x is half of 3x - 4; which is 1.5x - 2. So these equations are equivalent, but the slope-intercept form has the advantages of being simpler, and including two key pieces of information we need to plot the line represented by the equation. We know the y-intecept that the line passes through (0, -2), and we know the slope of the line (for every x, we add 1.5 to y.\n",
