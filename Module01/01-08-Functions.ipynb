    "\\begin{equation}u(x) = x + 1\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This function simply adds 1 to whatever input is passed to it, so it will produce a defined output for any value of ***x*** that is a *real* number; in other words, any \"regular\" number - but not an *imaginary* number like &radic;-1, or &infin; (infinity). You can specify the set of real numbers using the symbol ${\\rm I\\!R}$ (note the double stroke). The values that can be used for ***x*** can be expressed as a *set*, which we indicate by enclosing all of the members of the set in \"{...}\" braces; so to indicate the set of all possible values for x such that x is a member of the set of all real numbers, we can use the following expression:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\\{x \\in \\rm I\\!R\\}\\end{equation}\n",

    "### Domain of a Function\n",

Similarly, if we use the value **-3** for ***x***, the output will be **4**. However, what happens when we apply this function to an ***x*** value of **0**? Anything divided by 0 is undefined, so the function ***g*** doesn't work for an ***x*** value of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need a way to denote the domain of the function ***g*** by indicating the input values for which a defined output can be returned. Specifically, we need to restrict ***x*** to a specific list of values - specifically any real number that is not 0. To indicate this, we can use the following notation:\n",
