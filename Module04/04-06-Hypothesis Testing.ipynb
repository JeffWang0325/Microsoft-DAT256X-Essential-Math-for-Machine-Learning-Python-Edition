    "This illustrates all the *sample* results you could get if the null hypothesis was true (that is, the rating population mean is actually 0). Note that if the null hypothesis is true, it's still *possible* to get a sample with a mean ranging from just over -5 to just under 5. The question is how *probable* is it to get a sample with a mean as high we did for our 50-rating sample under the null hypothesis? And how improbable would it *need* to be for us to conclude that the null is, in fact, a poor explanation for our data? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we measure distance from the mean in standard deviations, so we need to find out how many standard deviations above the null-hypothesized population mean of 0 our sample mean is, and measure the area under the distribution curve from this point on - that will give us the probability of observing a mean that is *at least* as high as our sample mean. We call the number of standard deviations above the mean where our sample mean is found the *test statistic* (or sometimes just *t-statistic*), and we call the area under the curve from this point (representing the probability of observing a sample mean this high or greater) the *p-value*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the p-value tells us how probable our sample mean is when the null is true, but we need to set a threshold under which we consider this to be too improbable to be explained by random chance alone. We call this threshold our *critical value*, and we usually indicate it using the Greek letter alpha (**&alpha;**). You can use any value you think is appropriate for **&alpha;** - commonly a value of 0.05 (5%) is used, but there's nothing special about this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the t-statistic by performing a statistical test. Technically, when the standard deviation of the population is known, we call it a *z-test* (because a *normal* distribution is often called a *z-distribution* and we measure variance from the mean in multiples of standard deviation known as *z-scores*). When the standard deviation of the population is not known, the test is referred to as a *t-test* and based on an adjusted version of a normal distribution called a *student's t distribution*, in which the distribution is \"flattened\" to allow for more sample variation depending on the sample size. Generally, with a sample size of 30 or more, a t-test is approximately equivalent to a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this case we're performing a *single sample* test (we're comparing the mean from a single sample of ratings against the hypothesized population mean), and it's a *one-tailed* test (we're checking to see if the sample mean is *greater than* the null-hypothesized population mean - in other words, in the *right* tail of the distribution).\n",

    "The general formula for one-tailed, single-sample t-test is:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s \\div \\sqrt{n}} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, **x&#772;** is the sample mean, **&mu;** is the population mean, **s** is the standard deviation, and **n** is the sample size. You can think of the numerator of this equation (the expression at the top of the fraction) as a *signal*, and the denominator (the expression at the bottom of the fraction) as being *noise*. The signal measures the difference between the statistic and the null-hypothesized value, and the noise represents the random variance in the data in the form of standard deviation (or standard error). The t-statistic is the ratio of signal to noise, and measures the number of standard errors between the null-hypothesized value and the observed sample mean. A large value tells you that your \"result\" or \"signal\" was much larger than you would typically expect by chance.\n",

As long as our test statistic is in that region, we are in the extreme 5% of values (p < .05) and we reject the null hypothesis. In other words, our p-value now needs to be below .025, but it can be in either tail of the distribution. For convenience, we usually \"double\" the p-value in a two-tailed test so that we don't have to remember this rule and still compare against .05 (this is known as a \"two-tailed p-value\").
