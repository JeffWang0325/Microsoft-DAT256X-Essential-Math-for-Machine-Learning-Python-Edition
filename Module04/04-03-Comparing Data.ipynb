    "## Least Squares Regression\n",
    "In the previous examples, we drew a line on a scatter plot to show the *best fit* of the data. In many cases, your initial attempts to identify any colinearity might involve adding this kind of line by hand (or just mentally visualizing it); but as you may suspect from the use of the *numpy.**polyfit*** function in the code above, there are ways to calculate the coordinates for this line mathematically. One of the most commonly used techniques is *least squares regression*, and that's what we'll look at now.\n",

    "In the case of our scatter plot for our former-student's working hours, we already have our values for *x* (*Grade*) and *y* (*Hours*), so we just need to calculate the intercept and slope of the straight line that lies closest to those points. Then we can form a linear equation that calculates the a new *y* value on that line for each of our *x* (*Grade*) values - to avoid confusion, we'll call this new *y* value *f(x)* (because it's the output from a linear equation function based on *x*). The difference between the original *y* (*Hours*) value and the *f(x)* value is the *error* between our regression line of best fit and the actual *Hours* worked by the former student. Our goal is to calculate the slope and intercept for a line with the lowest overall error.\n",
    "\n",
