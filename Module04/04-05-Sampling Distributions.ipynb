    "# Working with Sampling Distributions\n",
    "Most statistical analysis involves working with distributions - usually of sample data.\n",

    "## Sampling and Sampling Distributions\n",
    "As we discussed earlier, when working with statistics, we usually base our calculations on a sample and not the full population of data. This means we need to allow for some variation between the sample statistics and the true parameters of the full population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, we knew the probability that a security search would be triggered was 25%, so it's pretty easy to calculate that the expected value for a random variable indicating the number of searches per 100 passengers is 25. What if we hadn't known the probability of a search? How could we estimate the expected mean number of searches for a given number of passengers based purely on sample data collected by observing passengers go through security?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Proportion Distribution from a Sample\n",
    "We know that the each passenger will either be searched or not searched, and we can assign the values ***0*** (for not searched) and ***1*** (for searched) to these outcomes. We can conduct a Bernoulli trial in which we sample 16 passengers and calculate the fraction (or *proportion*) of passengers that were searched (which we'll call ***p***), and the remaining proportion of passengers (which are the ones who weren't searched, and can be calculated as ***1-p***).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we record the following values for our 16-person sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample, there were 3 searches out of 16 passengers; which as a proportion is <sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub> or 0.1875. This is our proportion (or **p**); but because we know that this is based on a sample, we call it **p&#770;** (or p-hat). The remaining proportion of passengers is 1-p; in this case 1 - 0.1875, which is 0.8125.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data itself is *qualitative* (categorical) - we're indicating \"no search\" or \"search\"; but because we're using numeric values (0 and 1), we can treat these values as numeric and create a binomial distribution from them - it's the simplest form of a binomial distribution - a Bernoulli distribution with two values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're treating the results as a numberic distribution, we can also calculate statistics like *mean* and *standard deviation*:\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate these, you can use the following formulae:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\mu_{\\hat{p}} = \\hat{p}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is just the value of **p&#770;**, so in the case of the passenger search sample it is 0.1875.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\sigma_{\\hat{p}} = \\sqrt{0.1875 \\times 0.8125} \\approx 0.39\\end{equation}\n",

    "\n",
    "Well, using a single sample like this can be misleading because the number of searches can vary with each sample. Another person observing 100 passengers may get a (very) different result from you. One way to address this problem is to take multiple samples and combine the resulting means to form a *sampling* distribution.

This is the effect of the *central limit theorem*, and it applies to any distribution of sample data if the size of the sample is large enough. For our airport passenger data, if we collect a large enough number of samples, each based on a large enough number of passenger observations, the sampling distribution will be approximately normal. The larger the sample size, the closer to a perfect *normal* distribution the data will be, and the less variance around the mean there will be.\n",

    "### Mean and Standard Error of a Sampling Distribution of Proportion\n",
    "The sampling distribution is created from the means of multiple samples, and its mean is therefore the mean of all the sample means. For a distribution of proportion means, this is considered to be the same as **p** (the population mean). In the case of our passenger search samples, this is 0.25.\n",

For example, we know that in a normal distribution, around 95.4% of the values are within two standard deviations of the mean. If we apply that to our sampling distribution of ten thousand 100-passenger samples, we can determine that the proportion of searched passengers in 95.4% of the samples was between 0.164 (16.4%) and 0.336 (36.6%).\n",

    "## Confidence Intervals\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values around a sample statistic within which we are confident that the true parameter lies. For example, our bag weight sampling distribution is based on samples of the weights of bags carried by passengers through our airport security line. We know that the mean weight (the *expected value* for the weight of a bag) in our sampling distribution is 3.2, and we assume this is also the population mean for all bags; but how confident can we be that the true mean weight of all carry-on bags is close to the value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start to put some precision onto these terms. We could state the question another way. What's the range of weights within which are confident that the mean weight of a carry-on bag will be 95% of the time? To calculate this, we need to determine the range of values within which the population mean weight is likely to be in 95% of samples. This is known as a *confidence interval*; and it's based on the Z-scores inherent in a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are expressed as a sample statistic &plusmn; (*plus or minus*) a margin of error. To calculate the margin of error, you need to determine the confidence level you want to find (for example, 95%), and determine the Z score that marks the threshold above or below which the values that are *not* within the chosen interval reside. For example, to calculate a 95% confidence interval, you need the critical Z scores that exclude 5% of the values under the curve; with 2.5% of them being lower than the values in the confidence interval range, and 2.5% being higher. In a normal distribution, 95% of the area under the curve is between a Z score of &plusmn; 1.96. The following table shows the critical Z values for some other popular confidence interval ranges:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Confidence  | Z Score |\n",
    "|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| 90%         | 1.645   |\n",
    "| 95%         | 1.96    |\n",
    "| 99%         | 2.576   |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval around a sample statistic, we simply calculate the *standard error* for that statistic as described previously, and multiply this by the approriate Z score for the confidence interval we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the 95% confidence interval margin of error for our bag weights, we multiply our standard error of 0.053 by the Z score for a 95% confidence level, which is 1.96:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}MoE = 0.053 \\times 1.96 = 0.10388 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can say that we're confident that the population mean weight is in the range of the sample mean &plusmn; 0.10388 with 95% confidence. Thanks to the central limit theorem, if we used an even bigger sample size, the confidence interval would become smaller as the amount of variance in the distribution is reduced. If the number of samples were infinite, the standard error would be 0 and the confidence interval would become a certain value that reflects the true mean weight for all carry-on bags:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = 0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the *scipy.stats.**norm.interval*** function to calculate a confidence interval for a normal distribution. Run the following code to recreate the sampling distribution for bag searches with the same parameters, and display the 95% confidence interval for the mean (again, this may take some time to run):"
