    "# Probability\n",
    "Many of the problems we try to solve using statistics are to do with *probability*. For example, what's the probable salary for a graduate who scored a given score in their final exam at school? Or, what's the likely height of a child given the height of his or her parents?\n",
    "\n",
    "It therefore makes sense to learn some basic principles of probability as we study statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability Basics\n",
    "Let's start with some basic definitions and principles.\n",
    "- An ***experiment*** or ***trial*** is an action with an uncertain outcome, such as tossing a coin.\n",
    "- A ***sample space*** is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. In a coin toss, there's a set of two possible oucomes (*heads* and *tails*).\n",
    "- A ***sample point*** is a single possible outcome - for example, *heads*)\n",
    "- An ***event*** is a specific outome of single instance of an experiment - for example, tossing a coin and getting *tails*.\n",
    "- ***Probability*** is a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the likelihood of a particular event, with 0 meaning that the event is impossible, and 1 meaning that the event is inevitable. In general terms, it's calculated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\text{probability of an event} = \\frac{\\text{Number of sample points that produce the event}}{\\text{Total number of sample points in the sample space}} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the probability of getting *heads* when tossing as coin is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> - there is only one side of the coin that is designated *heads*. and there are two possible outcomes in the sample space (*heads* and *tails*). So the probability of getting *heads* in a single coin toss is 0.5 (or 50% when expressed as a percentage).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at another example. Suppose you throw two dice, hoping to get 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dice throw itself is an *experiment* - you don't know the outome until the dice have landed and settled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *sample space* of all possible outcomes is every combination of two dice - 36 *sample points*:\n",

    "Now that we know something about probability, let's apply that to statistics. Statistics is about inferring measures for a full population based on samples, allowing for random variation; so we're going to have to consider the idea of a *random variable*.\n",

    "A random variable us a number that can vary in value. For example, the temperature on a given day, or the number of students taking a class.\n",

    "### Binomial Variables\n",
    "One particular type of random variable that we use in statistics is a *binomial* variable. A binomial variable is used to count how frequently an event occurs in a fixed number of repeated independent experiments. The event in question must have the same probability of occurring in each experiment, and indicates the success or failure of the experiment; with a probability ***p*** of success, which has a complement of ***1 - p*** as the probability of failure (we often call this kind of experiment a *Bernoulli Trial* after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli).\n",

The possibile results include none of the flips resulting in *heads*, all of the flips resulting in *heads*, or any combination in between.

Some include a bias that makes success more or less likely - so we need to be a little more thorough in our calculations to allow for this.\n",
