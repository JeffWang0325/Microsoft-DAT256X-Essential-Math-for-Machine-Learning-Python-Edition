    "## Derivative Rules and Operations\n",
    "When working with derivatives, there are some rules, or shortcuts, that you can apply to make your life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Derivative Rules\n",
    "Let's start with some basic rules that it's useful to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If *f(x)* = *C* (where *C* is a constant), then *f'(x)* = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    This makes sense if you think about it for a second. No matter what value you use for *x*, the function returns the same constant value; so the graph of the function will be a horizontal line. There's no rate of change in a horiziontal line, so its slope is 0 at all points. This is true of any constant, including symbolic constants like *&pi;* (pi).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    So, for example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = 6 \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 0 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Or:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = \\pi \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 0 \\end{equation}\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If *f(x)* = *Cg(x)*, then *f'(x)* = *Cg'(x)*\n",
    "\n",
    "    This rule tells us that if a function is equal to a second function multiplied by a constant, then the derivative of the first function will be equal to the derivative of the second function multiplied by the same constant. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = 2g(x) \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 2g'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- If *f(x)* = *g(x)* + *h(x)*, then *f'(x)* = *g'(x)* + *h'(x)*\n",
    "\n",
    "    In other words, if a function is the sum of two other functions, then the derivative of the first function is the sum of the derivatives of the other two functions. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = g(x) + h(x) \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Of course, this also applies to subtraction:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = k(x) - l(x) \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = k'(x) - l'(x) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed previously, functions are just equations encapsulated as a named entity that return a value; and the rules can be applied to any equation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x + 6) = \\frac{d}{dx} 2x +  \\frac{d}{dx} 6\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can take advantage of the rules to make the calculation a little easier:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2(x+h) - 2x}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "After factoring out the* 2(x+h)* on the left, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2x + 2h - 2x}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simplify this to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2h}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = 2 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can turn our attention to the derivative of the constant 6 with respect to *x*, and we know that the derivative of a constant is always 0, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(6) = 0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We add the two derivatives we calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x + 6) = 2 + 0\\end{equation}\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}(2x + 6) = 2\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power Rule\n",
    "The *power rule* is one of the most useful shortcuts in the world of differential calculus. It can be stated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{n} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So if our function for *x* returns *x* to the power of some constant (which we'll call *n*), then the derivative of the function for *x* is *n* times *x* to the power of *n* - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's probably helpful to look at a few examples to see how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{3} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 3x^{2}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{2} \\;\\; \\therefore \\;\\; f'(x) = 2x\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these examples, the exponential of *x* in the function definition becomes the coefficient for *x* in the derivative definition, with the exponential is decremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a worked example to find the derivative of the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f(x) = x^{2}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So we start with the general derivative function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can plug in our definition for *f*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(x + h)^{2} - x^{2}}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can factor out the perfect square binomial on the left:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{x^{2} + h^{2} + 2xh - x^{2}}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The x<sup>2</sup> terms cancel each other out so we get to:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^{2} + 2xh}{h} \\end{equation}\n",

    "### The Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The *chain rule* takes advantage of the fact that equations can be encapsulated as functions, and since functions contain equations, it's possible to nest one function within another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}u(x) = 2x^{2} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We could view the definition of *u(x)* as a composite of two functions,; an *inner* function that calculates x<sup>2</sup>, and an *outer* function that multiplies the result of the inner function by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}u(x) = \\widehat{\\color{blue}2\\color{blue}(\\underline{\\color{red}x^{\\color{red}2}}\\color{blue})} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things simpler, we can name these inner and outer functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}i(x) = x^{2} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}o(x) = 2x \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that *x* indicates the input for each function. Function *i* takes its input and squares it, and function *o* takes its input and multiplies it by 2. When we use these as a composite function, the *x* value input into the outer function will be the output from the inner function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how we can apply these functions to get back to our original *u* function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}u(x) = o(i(x)) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So first we need to find the output of the inner *i* function so we can use at as the input value for the outer *o* function. Well, that's easy, we know the definition of *i* (square the input), so we can just plug it in:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}u(x) = o(x^{2}) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We also know the definition for the outer *o* function (multiply the input by 2), so we can just apply that to the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}u(x) = 2x^{2} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so now we know how to form a composite function. The *chain rule* can be stated like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}[o(i(x))] = o'(i(x)) \\cdot i'(x)\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let's start by plugging the output of the inner *i(x)* function in:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}[o(i(x))] = o'(x^{2}) \\cdot i'(x)\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's use that to calculate the derivative of *o*, replacing each *x* in the equation with the output from the *i* function (*x<sup>2</sup>*):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}o'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2(x^{2} + h) - 2x^{2}}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This factors out to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}o'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2x^{2} + 2h - 2x^{2}}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which when we cancel out the 2x<sup>2</sup> and -2x<sup>2</sup> is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}o'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{2h}{h} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}o'(x) = 2 \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can calculate *i'(x)*. We know that the definition of *i(x)* is x<sup>2</sup>, and we can use the power rule to determine that *i'(x)* is therefore 2x.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our equation at this point is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}[o(i(x))] = 2 \\cdot 2x\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}[o(i(x))] = 4x\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly, the chain rule is stated using a slighly different notation that you may find easier to work with. In this case, we can take our equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{d}{dx}[o(i(x))] = o'(i(x)) \\cdot i'(x)\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "and rewrite it as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{do}{di}\\frac{di}{dx}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then complete the calculations like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{du}{dx} = 2 \\cdot 2x = 4x\\end{equation}"
