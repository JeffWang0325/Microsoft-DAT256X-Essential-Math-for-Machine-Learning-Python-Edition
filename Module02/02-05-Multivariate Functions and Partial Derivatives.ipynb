    "# Partial Derivatives\n",
    "Until now, we've considered derivatives of functions that operate on a single variable. How do we take the derivatives of a function like the following?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take a derivative of the changes in the function with respect to either x or y. We call these derivatives with respect to one variable partial derivatives. Let's give this a try by taking the derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to ***x***. We write this partial derivative as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (x^2 + y^2)}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as ordinary derivatives give us a way to compute the rate of change of a function, partial derivatives give us a way to compute the rate of change of a function of many variables with respect to one of those variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $f(x,y)$ is the sum of several simpler functions we need to take the partial derivative of each of these and sum the result. The first two parts are easy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that we are following the usual rules of differentiation for any function of ***x*** here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to take the partial derivative of the last part of $f(x,y)$, which does not depend on ***x*** at all. In these care we get the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial y^2}{\\partial x} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can add up the parts to get the complete partail derivative of $f(x,y)$.\n",

    "## Computing a Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you may well ask what is the point of computing partial derivatives? Yes, they are a nifty math trick, but what are they good for? It turns out that partial derivatives are important if you want to find the analog of the slope for multi-dimensonal surfaces. We call this quantity the **gradient**. \n",
    "\n",
