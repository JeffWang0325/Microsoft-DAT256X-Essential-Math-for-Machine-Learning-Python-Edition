    "# Limits\n",
    "You can use algebraeic methods to calculate the rate of change over a function interval by joining two points on the function with a secant line and measuring its slope. For example, a function might return the distance travelled by a cyclist in a period of time, and you can use a secant line to measure the average velocity between two points in time. However, this doesn't tell you the cyclist's vecolcity at any single point in time - just the average speed over an interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the cyclist's velocity at a specific point in time, you need the ability to find the slope of a curve at a given point. *Differential Calculus* enables us to do through the use of *derivatives*. We can use derivatives to find the slope at a specific *x* value by calculating a delta for *x<sub>1</sub>* and *x<sub>2</sub>* values that are infinitesimally close together - so you can think of it as measuring the slope of a tiny straight line that comprises part of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Limits\n",
    "However, before we can jump straight into derivatives, we need to examine another aspect of differential calculus - the *limit* of a function; which helps us measure how a function's value changes as the *x<sub>2</sub>* value approaches *x<sub>1</sub>*\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand limits, let's take a closer look at our function, and note that although we graph the function as a line, it is in fact made up of individual points. Run the following cell to show the points that we've plotted for integer values of ***x*** - the line is created by interpolating the points in between:"
