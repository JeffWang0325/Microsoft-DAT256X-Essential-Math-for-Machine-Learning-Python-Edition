    "# Vectors\n",
    "Vectors, and vector spaces, are fundamental to *linear algebra*, and they're used in many machine learning models. Vectors describe spatial lines and planes, enabling you to perform calculations that explore relationships in multi-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Vector\n",
    "At its simplest, a vector is a numeric element that has both *magnitude* and *direction*. The magnitude represents a distance (for example, \"2 miles\") and the direction indicates which way the vector is headed (for example, \"East\"). Vectors are defined by an n-dimensional coordinate that describe a point in space that can be connected by a line from an arbitrary origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "That all seems a bit complicated, so let's start with a simple, two-dimensional example. In this case, we'll have a vector that is defined by a point in a two-dimensional plane: A two dimensional coordinate consists of an *x* and a *y* value, and in this case we'll use **2** for *x* and **1** for *y*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our vector can be written as **v**=(2,1), but more formally we would use the following notation, in which the dimensional coordinate values for the vector are shown as a matrix:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So what exactly does that mean? Well, the coordinate is two-dimensional, and describes the movements required to get to the end point (of *head*) of the vector - in this case, we need to move 2 units in the *x* dimension, and 1 unit in the *y* dimension. Note that we don't specify a starting point for the vector - we're simply describing a destination coordinate that encapsulate the magnitide and direction of the vector. Think about it as the directions you need to follow to get to *there* from *here*, without specifying where *here* actually is!\n",
    "\n",
    "It can help to visualize the vector, and with a two-dimensional vector, that's pretty straightforward. We just define a two-dimensional plane, choose a starting point, and plot the coordinate described by the vector relative to the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code in the following cell to visualize the vector **v** (which remember is described by the coordinate (2,1))."

    "## Calculating Vector Magnitude and Direction\n",
    "We tend to work with vectors by expressing their components as *cartesian coordinates*; that is, *x* and *y* (and other dimension) values that define the number of units travelled along each dimension. So the coordinates of our (2,1) vector indicate that we must travel 2 units along the *x* axis, and *1* unit along the *y* axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can also work with verctors in terms of their *polar coordinates*; that is coordinates that describe the magnitude and direction of the vector. The magnitude is the overall distance of the vector from tail to head, and the direction is the angle at which the vector is oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating Magnitude\n",
    "Calculating the magnitude of the vector from its cartesian coordinates requires measuring the distance between the arbitrary starting point and the vector head point. For a two-dimensional vector, we're actually just calculating the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle - so we could simply invoke Pythagorean theorum and calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of it's components, like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "The notation for a vector's magnitude is to surround the vector name with vertical bars - you can use single bars (for example, |**v**|) or double bars (||**v**||). Double-bars are often used to avoid confusion with absolute values. Note that the components of the vector are indicated by subscript indices (v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>,...v<sub>*n*</sub>),\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the vector **v** has two components with values **2** and **1**, so our magnitude calculation is:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\\|\\vec{v}\\| = \\sqrt{2^{2} + 1^{2}}\\end{equation}\n",

    "There is an added complication however, because if the value for *x* or *y* (or both) is negative, the orientation of the vector is not standard, and a calculator can give you the wrong tan<sup>-1</sup> value.

Tan<sup>-1</sup> of 4/-2 is around -64.4 degrees, which is the *negative* angle from x to the vector line; but in the wrong direction (as if the vector was travelling from quadrant 2 towards quadrant 4).

Tan<sup>-1</sup> of -4/2 is around -64.4 degrees, which is the *negative* angle from the x axis to the vector line.
